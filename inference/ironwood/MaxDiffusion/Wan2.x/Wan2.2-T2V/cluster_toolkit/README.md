# Inference Wan-AI/Wan2.2-T2V-A14B-Diffusers workload on Ironwood GKE clusters with Cluster Toolkit.

This recipe outlines the steps for running a maxdiffusion
[Maxdiffusion](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxdiffusion) inference workload on
[Ironwood GKE clusters](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) by using
[Cluster Toolkit](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cluster-toolkit).

## Workload Details

This workload is configured with the following details:

-   Model: Wan 2.2 Text-to-Video (T2V) 27B
-   num_frames: 81
-   width: 1280 (720p) or 832 (480p)
-   height: 720 (720p) or 480 (480p)
-   num_inference_steps: 40
-   fps: 16
-   TPU Cores: 7x-8 (tpu7x-2x2x1), 7x-16 (tpu7x-2x2x2)

## Prerequisites

To run this recipe, you need the following:

-   **GCP Project Setup:** Ensure you have a GCP project with billing enabled
    and have access to Ironwood.
-   **User Project Permissions:** The account used requires the following IAM
    Roles:
    -   Artifact Registry Writer
    -   Compute Admin
    -   Kubernetes Engine Admin
    -   Logging Admin
    -   Monitoring Admin
    -   Service Account User
    -   Storage Admin
    -   Vertex AI Administrator
    -   Service Usage Consumer
    -   TPU Viewer
-   **Docker:** Docker must be installed on your workstation. Follow the steps
    in the
    [Install Cluster Toolkit and dependencies](#install-cluster-toolkit-and-dependencies)
    section to install Docker.
-   **Cluster Toolkit (gcluster) and Dependencies:** Follow the steps in the
    [Install Cluster Toolkit and dependencies](#install-cluster-toolkit-and-dependencies)
    section to install Cluster Toolkit (`gcluster`), `gcloud`, `kubectl`, and
    the `gke-gcloud-auth-plugin`.
-   **Hugging Face Token:** The Wan 2.2 weights are pulled from Hugging Face at
    runtime, so a valid `HF_TOKEN` is required.

## Install Cluster Toolkit and dependencies

### Cluster Toolkit (gcluster)

Install Cluster Toolkit by downloading and extracting the prebuilt release
bundle:

```bash
# Set Cluster Toolkit version
export CTK_VERSION="1.104.0"

# Download the prebuilt bundle from GitHub releases
curl -L -O "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cluster-toolkit/releases/download/v${CTK_VERSION}/gcluster_bundle_linux_amd64.tgz"

# Extract the bundle
mkdir -p "${HOME}/cluster-toolkit"
tar -xzf gcluster_bundle_linux_amd64.tgz -C "${HOME}/cluster-toolkit"
rm gcluster_bundle_linux_amd64.tgz

# Add gcluster to your PATH
export PATH="${HOME}/cluster-toolkit:${PATH}"
echo 'export PATH="${HOME}/cluster-toolkit:${PATH}"' >> ~/.bashrc

# Verify installation
gcluster --version
```

### Tools (gcloud, kubectl, and auth plugin)

```bash
# Install Google Cloud SDK (gcloud): https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
# Install kubectl: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl#install_kubectl
# Install gke-gcloud-auth-plugin: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl#install_plugin

# Authenticate with Google Cloud
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
```

### Docker

Install Docker using instructions provided by your administrator. Once
installed, run the following commands:

```bash
## Configure docker and test installation
gcloud auth configure-docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER ## relaunch the terminal after running this command
docker run hello-world # Test docker
```

## Orchestration and deployment tools

For this recipe, the following setup is used:

-   **Orchestration** -
    [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)
-   **Inference job configuration and deployment** -
    [Cluster Toolkit](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cluster-toolkit)
    (`gcluster`) is used to configure and deploy the
    [Kubernetes Jobset](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/23/introducing-jobset)
    resource, which manages the execution of the Maxdiffusion Wan models.

## Test environment

This recipe is tested with `7x-8` and `7x-16`.

-   **GKE cluster** To create your GKE cluster, refer to the
    [Cloud TPU deployments overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/cluster-toolkit/docs/deploy/gke/gke-tpu-overview)
    and the
    [Cloud TPU 7x (Ironwood) GKE deployment guide](https://docs.cloud.google.com/cluster-toolkit/docs/deploy/gke/gke-tpu-7x#deploy-tpu-7x-cluster).
    A sample Cluster Toolkit cluster creation and deployment command is provided
    below.

### Environment Variables for Cluster Creation

The environment variables required for cluster creation and workload execution
are defined at the beginning of the `run_recipe.sh` script. **Before running the
`gcluster job submit` command**, please open `run_recipe.sh` and modify the
`export` statements to set these variables to match your environment. It is
crucial to use consistent values for `PROJECT_ID`, `CLUSTER_NAME`, and `ZONE`
across all commands and configurations.

-   `PROJECT_ID`: Your GCP project name.
-   `CLUSTER_NAME`: The target cluster name.
-   `ZONE`: The zone for your cluster (e.g., `us-central1-c`).
-   `REGION`: The region for your cluster (e.g., `us-central1`). Can be derived
    as `${ZONE%-*}`.
-   `CONTAINER_REGISTRY`: The container registry to use (e.g., `gcr.io`).
-   `BASE_OUTPUT_DIR`: Output directory for model logs/artifacts (e.g.,
    `"gs://<your_gcs_bucket>"`).
-   `HF_TOKEN`: Your Hugging Face access token, used to download the Wan 2.1
    weights.
-   `WORKLOAD_IMAGE`: The Docker image for the workload. This is set to a
    placeholder
    `<YOUR_CONTAINER_REGISTRY>/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>/<YOUR_IMAGE_NAME>:latest` by
    default.
-   `WORKLOAD_NAME`: A unique name for your workload. This is generated in
    `run_recipe.sh` from your username, a random suffix, and a timestamp.
-   `ACCELERATOR_TYPE`: The TPU machine type and topology (e.g.,
    `tpu7x-standard-4t` with topology `2x2x1` or `2x2x2`). See topologies
    [here](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/plan-tpus#configuration).
-   `RESERVATION_NAME`: Your TPU reservation name. Use the reservation name if
    within the same project. For a shared project, use
    `"projects/<project_number>/reservations/<reservation_name>"`.

If you don't have a GCS bucket, create one with this command:

```bash
# Make sure BASE_OUTPUT_DIR is set in run_recipe.sh before running this.
gcloud storage buckets create ${BASE_OUTPUT_DIR} --project=${PROJECT_ID} --location=US  --default-storage-class=STANDARD --uniform-bucket-level-access
```

### Sample Cluster Toolkit Cluster Creation Command

Deploy the standard Ironwood blueprint to provision the GKE infrastructure using
`gcluster deploy`:

```bash
cd ~/cluster-toolkit
./gcluster deploy examples/gke-tpu-7x/gke-tpu-7x.yaml \
  --backend-config="bucket=${TF_STATE_BUCKET}" \
  --vars="project_id=${PROJECT_ID},deployment_name=${CLUSTER_NAME},region=${REGION},zone=${ZONE},num_slices=1,machine_type=tpu7x-standard-4t,tpu_topology=2x2x1,reservation=${RESERVATION_NAME}"
```

Once deployment is complete, fetch credentials to configure `kubectl` access and
verify that the cluster and TPU nodes are ready:

```bash
# Connect to your cluster and configure kubectl credentials
gcloud container clusters get-credentials "${CLUSTER_NAME}" \
  --region="${REGION}" \
  --project="${PROJECT_ID}"

# Verify that cluster nodes are in Ready state
kubectl get nodes
```

## Docker container image

To build your own image, follow the steps linked in this section. If you don't
have Docker installed on your workstation, see the section above for installing
Cluster Toolkit and its dependencies. Docker installation is part of this
process.

### Steps for building workload image

The following software versions are used:

-   Libtpu version: 0.0.40
-   Jax version: 0.10.0
-   MaxDiffusion version: 08566b1
-   Python: 3.12
-   Cluster Toolkit: 1.104.0

Docker Image Building Command:

```bash
export CONTAINER_REGISTRY="" # Initialize with your registry
export CLOUD_IMAGE_NAME="${USER}-maxdiffusion-runner"
export WORKLOAD_IMAGE="${CONTAINER_REGISTRY}/${PROJECT_ID}/${CLOUD_IMAGE_NAME}"
export PROJECT_ID=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>

# Clone MaxDiffusion Repository and checkout recipe commit
git clone https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxdiffusion.git
cd maxdiffusion
git checkout 08566b1

# Build and upload the docker image
bash docker_build_dependency_image.sh

# Connect to your project
gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}

# Upload the image to your project's docker registry with the name ${CLOUD_IMAGE_NAME}
bash docker_upload_runner.sh CLOUD_IMAGE_NAME=${CLOUD_IMAGE_NAME}
```

## Testing prompt

This recipe uses a single prompt for testing video generation speed.

## Run the recipe

### Configure environment settings

Before running any commands in this section, ensure you have set the environment
variables as described in
[Environment Variables for Cluster Creation](#environment-variables-for-cluster-creation).

### Connect to an existing cluster (Optional)

If you want to connect to your GKE cluster to see its current state before
running the benchmark, you can use the following gcloud command:

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials ${CLUSTER_NAME} --project ${PROJECT_ID} --zone ${ZONE}
```

## Get the recipe

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/ai-hypercomputer/tpu-recipes.git
cd tpu-recipes/inference/ironwood/MaxDiffusion/Wan2.x/Wan2.2-T2V/cluster_toolkit
```

### Run Maxdiffusion inference Workload

The `run_recipe.sh` script contains all the necessary environment variables and
configurations to launch the Wan inference workload.

Before execution, use `nano ./run_recipe.sh` to edit the script and configure the
environment variables to match your specific environment.

To configure and run the benchmark:

```bash
# --- Environment Variables ---
export PROJECT_ID=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
export CLUSTER_NAME=<YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME>
export ZONE=<YOUR_CLUSTER_ZONE>
export BASE_OUTPUT_DIR="" # E.g. gs://<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>
export HF_TOKEN=<YOUR_HF_TOKEN>
export TPU_TYPE=<YOUR_HARDWARE_TYPE> # Supported values: 7x-8, 7x-16 (or exact TPU topologies: tpu7x-2x2x1, tpu7x-2x2x2)
export RESOLUTION=<720p or 480p> # Supported: 720p, 480p (Defaults to 720p)
export WORKLOAD_IMAGE=<YOUR_WORKLOAD_IMAGE> # E.g. gcr.io/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>/<YOUR_IMAGE_NAME> or nightly pre-built image

chmod +x run_recipe.sh
nano ./run_recipe.sh
./run_recipe.sh
```

You can customize the run by modifying `run_recipe.sh`:

-   **Environment Variables:** Adjust environmental variables like `PROJECT_ID`,
    `CLUSTER_NAME`, `ZONE`, `WORKLOAD_NAME`, `WORKLOAD_IMAGE`, and
    `BASE_OUTPUT_DIR` to match your environment.
-   **XLA Flags:** The `XLA_FLAGS` variable contains a set of XLA configurations
    optimized for Ironwood TPUs. These can be tuned for performance or
    debugging.
-   **MaxDiffusion Workload Overrides:** The `MAXDIFFUSION_ARGS` variable holds
    the arguments passed to the `python src/maxdiffusion/generate_wan.py`
    command. This includes model-specific settings like `per_device_batch_size`,
    `num_inference_steps`, and others. You can modify these to experiment with
    different model configurations.

Note that any MaxDiffusion configurations not explicitly overridden in
`MAXDIFFUSION_ARGS` are expected to use the defaults within the specified
`WORKLOAD_IMAGE`.

### Hugging Face cache location

Cluster Toolkit refuses to mount onto the reserved system path `/dev/shm`, so the
recipe mounts the host's `/dev/shm` tmpfs at `/dev_shm` inside the container
(`--mount "/dev/shm;/dev_shm;rw"`) and sets `HF_HUB_CACHE=/dev_shm` accordingly.
`/tmp` is not a viable alternative: the root ephemeral disk is too small for the
Wan model weights and the pod is evicted mid-download.

## Monitor the job

To monitor your job's progress, you can use kubectl to check the Jobset status
and stream logs:

```bash
kubectl get jobset -n default ${WORKLOAD_NAME}

# Get the name of the first pod in the JobSet
POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -l jobset.sigs.k8s.io/jobset-name=${WORKLOAD_NAME} -n default -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

# Follow the logs of that pod
kubectl logs -f -n default ${POD_NAME}
```

You can also monitor your cluster and TPU usage through the Google Cloud
Console.

### Follow Workload and View Metrics

List workloads using Cluster Toolkit (`gcluster job list`):

```bash
gcluster job list --cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME} --project ${PROJECT_ID} --location ${ZONE}
```

For more in-depth debugging, inspect the workload with `gcluster job inspect`:

```bash
gcluster job inspect --cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME} --project ${PROJECT_ID} --location ${ZONE} --name ${WORKLOAD_NAME}
```

View workload logs with `gcluster job logs`:

```bash
gcluster job logs ${WORKLOAD_NAME} --cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME} --project ${PROJECT_ID} --location ${ZONE}
```

### Delete resources

#### Delete a specific workload

To cancel and delete the workload using Cluster Toolkit:

```bash
gcluster job cancel ${WORKLOAD_NAME} --cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME} --project ${PROJECT_ID} --location ${ZONE}
```

Or delete the JobSet directly using kubectl:

```bash
kubectl delete jobset ${WORKLOAD_NAME} -n default
```

#### Delete the entire cluster

To avoid recurring charges, destroy the cluster infrastructure provisioned by
Cluster Toolkit:

```bash
cd ~/cluster-toolkit
./gcluster destroy ${CLUSTER_NAME} --auto-approve
```

## Check results

After the job completes, you can check the results by:

-   Video generated can be found in the Google Cloud Storage bucket specified by
    the `${BASE_OUTPUT_DIR}/${WORKLOAD_NAME}` variable.
-   Per video generation time (throughput) can be found by extracting the
    tensorboard content using event_accumulator inside
    tensorboard.backend.event_processing.
-   Accessing output logs from your job using `kubectl logs` or `gcluster job
    logs`. The recipe also uploads the captured stdout to
    `${BASE_OUTPUT_DIR}/${WORKLOAD_NAME}/logs/`.

## Next steps: deeper exploration and customization

This recipe is designed to provide a simple, reproducible "0-to-1" experience
for running a Maxdiffusion inference workload on Ironwood. Its primary purpose is to help you
verify your environment and achieve a first success with TPUs quickly and
reliably.
